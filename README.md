# Optical-Character-Recognition
CS 404 Deep Learning assignment 4.

This project uses a feedforward neural network in Python to recognize photos of hand-written characters. Current accuracy is 98.16% on the test data set and nearly 100% on the training data set. Future work using convolution neural networks will hopefully yield higher than 99% accuracy on the training data.
